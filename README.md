# Application Programming Interface for the Integrated Evaluation Framework [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/integrated-evaluation-framework/IEvaluate-API.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/integrated-evaluation-framework/IEvaluate-API)
The API provides a relatively static point of access for extensions to the IEvaluate Framework, most notably through the
use of Plugins to introduce new integrations and application types. It is recommended that all extension plugins 
interact as much as possible with classes from this API as behaviour consistency is guaranteed compared to the core
implementations
